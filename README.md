the initialization of many meows to come
I am a Computer Science graduate from The Master's University
I live in Japan currently and am working as an English teacher, but desire to become a video game developer either in Japan, America, or Germany
I am studying Japanese
I like cats
And pizza.
Especially if they are flying
